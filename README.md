<h1 align="center">Member Management System</h1>

This system was designed and constructed for a specific client, wich had specific requirements about how the management of members was to be done.
During the interview process and requirements identification, i found that the system has five axes, these are:
- Registration/Withdrawal/Modification/Reading of members.
- Linking member with category, of which certain conditions must be met to belong (detailed below)
- Linking members with family groups (adherent members).
- Manual generation of debts.
- Members legal book.

As "secondary points" we have:
- Impression of main members fee receipt, collection control for collectors, members legal book by year.
- Category change suggestion alerts.

<h3>Main members:</h3>
These are the ones that paid the month bill, this type of member can have adherent members associated and debts in their name.

<h3>Adherent members:</h3>
These are the family group of the main member. The main member can have many adherent member.

<h3>Categories:</h3>
The client asked for 6 categories, each with a monthly fee and a set of conditions that the main member must meet to belong. (It is important to clarify that the user can select any category, but the system will display alerts with suggestions for change if the conditions are not met or if there is a more suitable category for the main member's profile.) These are:

- **Individual | Individual :**  The main member must not have any additional members.
- **Grupo Familiar (Menores) | Family Group (Minors) :** The main member must have at least one adherent member of type "Hijo/a" (son/daughter) who is a minor.
- **Grupo Familiar (Mayores) | Family Group (Majors):** The main member must have at least one adherent member of type "Hijo/a" (son/daughter) who is 18 years old or older.
- **Grupo Familiar (MÃ¡s de un Mayor) | Family Group (Multiple Majors) :** The main member must have more than one adherent member of type "Hijo/a" (son/daughter) who is 18 years old or older.
- **Comercio | Business :** The main member must be the owner of a business or the business itself.
- **Hogar de Ancianos | Nursing Home :** The main member must be the representative of a nursing home or the nursing home itself.

<h3>Debts:</h3>
These are manually generated by the user, they represent the late payment by a main member of one or more monthly fees.

<h3>Legal Book:</h3>
This is a list of some specific data of the main members, ordered by the date of admission. 

## Technologies used:
The system is developed in Java, utilizing the "Spring Boot" framework, adapted for use with FXML views and their controllers in JavaFX. Additionally, Spring Data JPA is employed for data persistence in a PostgreSQL database. Furthermore, JasperReports library is incorporated for PDF printing functionality.

This adaptation was chosen to harness the powerful capabilities of the "Spring Boot" framework, particularly its seamless movement of data between different components of the system. While "Spring Boot" is commonly associated with web applications, its versatile features make it suitable for diverse project types, including desktop applications. By integrating "Spring Boot" with JavaFX, the system benefits from enhanced data flow and communication between frontend and backend components. This streamlined approach not only accelerates development but also simplifies maintenance and ensures the scalability of the desktop application.

Moreover, leveraging Spring Data JPA simplifies database operations by providing powerful abstractions and reducing boilerplate code. Integrating JasperReports facilitates seamless generation of PDF documents, enhancing the system's reporting capabilities. Overall, this combination of technologies ensures a modern, efficient, and scalable solution for the development of the desktop application.

## Installation instructions:
Before proceeding with the installation steps, you must have the following prerequisites installed:

- JDK 20 (for WINDOWS 64 bits: https://download.oracle.com/java/20/archive/jdk-20.0.2_windows-x64_bin.exe)
- PostgreSQL server running on localhost:5432 (for WINDOWS 64 bits: https://sbp.enterprisedb.com/getfile.jsp?fileid=1258893)

  <h3>Instalation Steps:</h3>

1. Go to the final release: https://github.com/aleberh23/member-management-system/releases/tag/final.
2. Download the .zip file called: "release.1.1.final".
3. Extract the compressed file.
4. In the folder you have the test database backup, and a .bat script, here you have two options.
    - Execute the script, this will automatically create the DB called 'bomberos_socios', then executes the command pg_restore to restore the backup to the new DB, and finally changes the password for the user 'postgres' to 'postgres'.
    - Do this process manually, by creating the DB "bomberos_socios" in pg_admin or by command line, restoring the DB backup called "bomberos_socios_ghubtest.sql", and finally changing the password of postgres user to 'postgres'.
5. Open the .exe file of the system.
6. Login screen should appear after about 10 seconds, the user is 'test' and the password '123'.
7. Now the system is ready to use!
